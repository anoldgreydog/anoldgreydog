- 👋 Hi, I’m @anoldgreydog
- 👀 In a former life, I was a software developer: 30 years using FORTRAN, then C and, for the last 10 years, C++. 10 years ago, I left the industry and spent the next few years as a photographer. Now that I'm retired, I'm filling some of the time during lockdown re-honing my old skills in a new setting.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Typescript, Electron, React
- 💞️ I’m Doing this for a bit of fun, to see if I can create a couple of apps for my MacBook that would be useful to me.
- 📫 How to reach me: message me here, or I occasionally check in on Twitter @greydogphoto, although that service has gone a bit too toxic for my tastes.
